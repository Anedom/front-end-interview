# Luma Front End Engineering Interview

## Assumptions
- **Tests will be made manually after the development is complete**, if I were to go with TDD I would have used a combination of Jest, react-testing-library, Enzyme, and Cypress for a complete test suite but due to time constraints, I choose to proceed without tests.
- **That there will be no error when sending the referrals**, it's trivial to simply treat the error code from the response, but the design spec contains neither error screens nor alternative flows therefore I opted to not code this flow.
- **No need for branches**, I'm thinking of this as one feature therefore there is no need for other branches.
- **Desktop first**, I choose this path due to the design spec and the persona I thought would use this platform.


*P.S.:* For whoever created this test, congrats you have great tv show taste.
